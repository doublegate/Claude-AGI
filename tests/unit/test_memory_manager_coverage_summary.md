# Memory Manager Test Coverage Summary

## Coverage Achievement
- **Initial Coverage**: 75.10% (184/245 lines)
- **Final Coverage**: 95.10% (233/245 lines)
- **Improvement**: +20% coverage (49 additional lines covered)

## Test Files Created
1. `test_memory_manager.py` - Original test file with 9 test methods
2. `test_memory_manager_extended.py` - Extended test file with 55 additional test methods

## Lines Still Not Covered (12 lines)
The remaining uncovered lines are import fallback handlers that only execute when optional dependencies are not installed:

- **Lines 12-14**: ImportError handler for numpy
- **Lines 19-21**: ImportError handler for sentence_transformers  
- **Lines 26-29**: ImportError handler for database modules
- **Lines 429-430**: Exception handler in clear_working_memory (partially covered)

These import handlers are difficult to test in a normal test environment as they require running tests without these packages installed.

## Key Test Scenarios Added
1. **Database Integration Tests**
   - Successful database initialization
   - Database connection failures with fallback
   - Database operations (store, recall, search)
   - Error handling for all database operations

2. **Memory Storage Tests**
   - High/low importance thought storage
   - Thoughts with/without embeddings
   - Empty content handling
   - Memory consolidation with database

3. **Context Management Tests**
   - Database-backed context storage
   - In-memory fallback scenarios
   - Error handling for context operations

4. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**
   - Missing modules/dependencies
   - JSON serialization errors
   - Database connection errors
   - Working memory limits
   - Vector store operations

5. **Message Handling Tests**
   - Store thought messages
   - Recall messages
   - Consolidate messages
   - Unknown message types

## Testing Best Practices Applied
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
- Testing both success and failure paths
- Edge case coverage
- Proper async/await test patterns
- Clear test documentation and organization
