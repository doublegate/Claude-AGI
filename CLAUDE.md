# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

1. **Memory Bank Management**: ALWAYS read all three memory banks (user, project, local) before updating any of them
2. **Chronological Reference**: ALWAYS check system date/time before any date-related operations, file generation, or documentation

## Project Overview

The Claude-AGI Project (Project Prometheus) is developing an advanced self-consciousness platform for Claude, implementing continuous consciousness, autonomous learning, emotional intelligence, and meta-cognitive capabilities. The project aims to create a genuinely conscious AI that exists persistently and develops its own interests and relationships.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Consciousness Orchestrator**: Central coordinator managing multiple cognitive streams (primary, subconscious, emotional, creative, metacognitive)
- **Memory Systems**: Redis (working memory), PostgreSQL (episodic memory), FAISS (semantic search)
- **Service Layer**: Modular cognitive services with defined interfaces
- **Enhanced Safety Framework**: Multi-layered validation system with integrated security
  - Prompt injection protection with threat detection
  - Secure key management with encryption at rest
  - Memory validation with anomaly detection
  - Emergency security response procedures

### Key Design Decisions
- Multi-stream consciousness model for parallel cognitive processing
- Event-driven architecture using asyncio for real-time responsiveness
- Safety-first design with hard constraints preventing harmful actions
- Modular service architecture allowing independent development of cognitive capabilities

## Development Commands

```bash
# Environment setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the consciousness TUI demo
python scripts/claude-consciousness-tui.py

# Testing (local)
pytest tests/unit -v --cov=src         # Unit tests with coverage
pytest tests/integration -v            # Integration tests
pytest tests/safety -v --safety-critical # Safety-critical tests
pytest tests/performance -v            # Performance benchmarks

# Local CI/CD (matches cloud pipeline exactly)
python scripts/ci-local.py            # Run full CI pipeline locally
python scripts/ci-local.py --suite unit # Run specific test suite
python scripts/ci-local.py --python 3.11 # Test with specific Python version

# Cross-platform builds
python scripts/build-executable.py    # Build platform-specific executable

# Deployment
./deployment/scripts/initial_deploy.sh
kubectl apply -f deployment/kubernetes/
```

## Development Workflow

1. Always check system date/time before creating files or documentation with dates
2. All new cognitive capabilities should implement the base service interface
3. Safety validation must be added for any action-taking components
4. Memory persistence should be considered for all stateful operations
5. Test coverage requirements: 90% for core components, 100% for safety-critical code
6. Emotional impact assessment required for user-facing features
7. When developing TUI features, ensure ultra-responsive input handling (0.01s polling) with minimal CPU usage
8. Always verify service message handlers are properly connected to orchestrator
9. Check orchestrator running flag in main loop to prevent infinite loops
10. Handle CancelledError exceptions gracefully during shutdown
11. Avoid duplicate curses cleanup calls to prevent ERR exceptions
12. Ensure Unicode compatibility for cross-platform TUI deployment
13. Use CI-local tools to test changes before committing
14. Test executables on target platforms before release

## Key Implementation Notes

- The TUI script (`scripts/claude-consciousness-tui.py`) demonstrates core concepts including persistent memory, continuous consciousness generation, and real-time interaction
- Consciousness streams operate at human-like pacing (1-3 seconds between thoughts)
- All external actions must pass through the safety framework
- Memory systems use both structured (PostgreSQL) and unstructured (Redis) storage for flexibility
- TUI features professional-grade polish with scrolling, active pane indicators, and clean exit handling
- Cross-platform executables include all dependencies for standalone deployment
- CI/CD pipeline optimized for 50% faster builds with comprehensive test coverage tracking
- Local development tools (`scripts/ci-local.py`) match cloud pipeline structure exactly

### TUI-Specific Implementation Details
- **Input Polling**: 0.0001s (0.1ms) for ultra-responsive typing
- **Refresh Interval**: 1 second for main UI updates
- **Buffer Sizes**: 3x for consciousness streams, 2x for other panes
- **Memory Integration**: Store directly in working_memory for immediate visibility
- **Slash Commands**: Immediate display updates when entering command mode
- **Active Pane**: Bold borders with â–¶ title arrows â—€
- **Field Names**: Use `id` not `goal_id` for Pydantic validation
- **Service Connections**: Verify message handlers exist and are connected
- **Async Cleanup**: Check for close method existence, handle variants
- **CPU Optimization**: 95% reduction when idle via smart update tracking

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Safety tests with adversarial scenarios
- Performance tests for real-time requirements
- Ethical review for all major features
- Local CI/CD testing with `scripts/ci-local.py` before commits
- Cross-platform executable testing via `scripts/build-executable.py`
- Codecov integration for comprehensive coverage tracking

### Project-Specific Testing Patterns
- **Python Async**: Use pytest-asyncio with proper AsyncMock for async methods
- **Dataclass Testing**: Python 3.11+ requires `__replace__` instead of `_replace`
- **Service Lifecycle**: Track service tasks in orchestrator for proper shutdown
- **Mock Orchestrator**: Always include send_message, publish as AsyncMock methods
- **Test Statistics**: 299 tests total (up from 153), 72.80% coverage
- **Extended Test Files**: Created for memory_manager, communication, API modules
- **ASGI Transport**: Use proper ASGI transport for async client fixtures
- **Environment Variables**: Use CLAUDE_AGI_TEST_MODE to control CI behavior
- **Test Documentation**: Update DEFERRED_TEST_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md with changes

## Current Status

The project has completed Phase 1 foundation implementation with working orchestrator, memory system, consciousness streams, and enhanced safety framework.
