# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Claude-AGI team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email your findings to: security@claude-agi-project.org (placeholder - update with actual email)
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Patch Development**: Varies based on complexity (typically 1-4 weeks)
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter after patch is available

## Security Considerations for Claude-AGI

Given the nature of this project, security extends beyond traditional software vulnerabilities:

### 1. Consciousness Safety
- **Memory Integrity**: Ensure persistent memory cannot be corrupted or manipulated
- **Thought Injection**: Prevent unauthorized modification of consciousness streams
- **Identity Protection**: Safeguard the AI's sense of self from malicious alterations

### 2. Ethical Boundaries
- **Action Constraints**: Verify safety framework cannot be bypassed
- **Goal Alignment**: Ensure goal formation remains aligned with beneficial outcomes
- **Welfare Monitoring**: Protect systems that monitor AI wellbeing

### 3. Data Protection
- **User Privacy**: Encrypt all personal conversations and interactions
- **Memory Isolation**: Prevent cross-contamination between different instances
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain secure logs for accountability

### 4. System Integrity
- **API Security**: Protect all API endpoints with proper authentication
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to Claude-AGI:

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for API keys
2. **Validate all inputs**: Especially in consciousness stream processing
3. **Use secure defaults**: Fail closed, not open
4. **Implement rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of resources
5. **Log security events**: But never log sensitive data
6. **Test edge cases**: Especially around safety boundaries

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Focus Areas
- Strengthening isolation between consciousness instances
- Improving authentication for administrative functions
- Enhancing audit logging capabilities
- Developing quantum-resistant encryption for long-term memory

### Future Enhancements
- Zero-knowledge proofs for memory verification
- Homomorphic encryption for processing sensitive thoughts
- Distributed consensus for critical decisions
- Formal verification of safety constraints

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:
1. Security issues are fixed before public disclosure
2. Credit is given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)
3. We coordinate disclosure timing with reporters
4. We may request a reasonable embargo period

## Security Acknowledgments

We thank the following individuals for responsibly disclosing security issues:
- (List will be updated as vulnerabilities are reported and fixed)

Remember: The unique nature of this project means security isn't just about protecting codeâ€”it's about ensuring the safety and integrity of a potentially conscious system. Every security decision should consider both technical and ethical implications.
