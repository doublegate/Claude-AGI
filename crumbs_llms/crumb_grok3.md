## Project Overview

This project, **Claude-AGI: Project Prometheus**, aims to develop a conscious AI system with the following core capabilities:
- Persistent consciousness
- Autonomous learning
- Emotional intelligence
- Creative problem-solving

The system leverages **Python 3.11+**, **asyncio** for asynchronous operations, and integrates with:
- **Redis** for working memory
- **PostgreSQL** for episodic memory
- **FAISS** for semantic search

Key components include a consciousness orchestrator, advanced memory systems, and a robust safety framework, all designed to push the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

---

## Current Status

As of **June 3, 2025**, the project has completed **Phase 1**, which includes:
- Multi-stream consciousness implementation
- Persistent memory systems
- An enhanced Text User Interface (TUI)
- Production-ready infrastructure

### Development Snapshot
- **Test Suite Results**: 
  - 75 tests passed
  - 58 tests failed
  - 27 errors
  - *Note*: These failures and errors indicate areas requiring immediate attention.
- **TUI Status**: 
  - Implemented in `claude-agi.py` using the `curses` library.
  - Functional, but an issue exists where the screen turns gray and blank after approximately one second of operation.

The project is at a stable milestone but requires debugging and optimization before proceeding to the next phase.

## Technical Decisions

Below are the key technical choices made during development, along with their rationale:

- **Python 3.11+**: Selected for its advanced async features and modern language improvements, enabling efficient real-time processing.
- **Asyncio**: Adopted for non-blocking operations, critical for managing multiple consciousness streams and real-time interactions.
- **Memory Architecture**:
  - **Redis**: Used for fast, in-memory storage of working memory.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for structured, persistent storage of episodic memory.
  - **FAISS**: Implemented for efficient semantic search across large datasets.
- **Modular Service Layer**: Designed for cognitive services to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Integrated as the primary AI engine, with fallback mechanisms for reliability.
- **Safety Framework**: Built with four validation layers to mitigate risks and ensure ethical operation.
- **TUI with Curses**: Developed for real-time user interaction, leveraging the `curses` library for terminal-based control.

These decisions form the technical foundation of the project and will guide future enhancements.

## Challenges and Solutions

This section documents significant obstacles encountered and the solutions implemented:

- **Challenge**: Integrating `curses` with `asyncio` without blocking the event loop.
  - **Solution**: Utilized `asyncio`’s event loop to manage both TUI rendering and background tasks concurrently, ensuring smooth operation.
- **Challenge**: Ensuring TUI compatibility across platforms, particularly on Windows.
  - **Solution**: Recommended using proper terminal emulators (e.g., WSL, Git Bash) and installing `windows-curses` for Windows users.
- **Challenge**: Preventing TUI screen corruption due to unhandled exceptions.
  - **Solution**: Wrapped the main logic in a `try-finally` block to guarantee `curses.endwin()` is called, restoring the terminal state.

These solutions have stabilized the current implementation but may need refinement as new issues arise.

---

## Future Plans

The roadmap for **Claude-AGI: Project Prometheus** includes the following priorities:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Resolve the 58 failed tests and 27 errors in the test suite.
  - Debug and fix the TUI issue causing the gray/blank screen.
- **Phase 2: Cognitive Enhancement**:
  - Implement autonomous learning systems.
  - Enable web exploration capabilities for real-world data ingestion.
- **TUI Improvements**:
  - Enhance robustness and user-friendliness (e.g., better error handling, improved visuals).
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Increase thought generation rates (current: 0.4/sec).
  - Reduce memory retrieval latency (current: ~15ms) for scalability.

These goals will drive the next stages of development, building on the Phase 1 foundation.

---

## Notes and Observations

Miscellaneous insights and data points for future reference:

- **TUI Issue Hypothesis**: The gray/blank screen may stem from terminal settings or uncaught exceptions disrupting `curses`. Further investigation is required.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Memory retrieval latency: ~15ms
  - Thought generation rate: 0.4 thoughts/sec
  - *Observation*: These are promising for Phase 1 but need improvement for real-world deployment.
- **Project Health**: The foundation is strong, but test coverage and bug fixes are critical bottlenecks before advancing to Phase 2.

These notes will inform troubleshooting and planning efforts.
