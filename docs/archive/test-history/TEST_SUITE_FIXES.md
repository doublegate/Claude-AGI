### All Tasks Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The test suite is now fully operational with:
- **153 tests all passing** (100% pass rate)
- **49.61% code coverage** achieved
- **No event loop warnings** - proper async handling
- **All mocks properly implemented** - no external dependencies needed
- **Stable test execution** - no flaky tests

### Test Execution Summary
```bash
# All tests now pass with:
python scripts/run_tests.py all

# Coverage report shows 49.61% coverage:
python scripts/run_tests.py coverage

# Individual test categories all pass:
python scripts/run_tests.py unit        # 85 tests
python scripts/run_tests.py integration # 25 tests
python scripts/run_tests.py safety      # 20 tests
python scripts/run_tests.py performance # 23 tests
```

### Key Achievements
1. âœ… Fixed all orchestrator tests with proper state management
2. âœ… Fixed safety framework tests with all validators
3. âœ… Fixed AI integration tests with proper mocking
4. âœ… Fixed consciousness stream tests with coordination
5. âœ… Fixed database connection tests with mock managers
6. âœ… Fixed integration tests with service initialization
7. âœ… Fixed performance tests with proper benchmarks

### Next Steps for Test Suite
1. **Increase Coverage**: Work towards 85%+ coverage target
2. **Add Edge Cases**: Test more boundary conditions
3. **Property-Based Testing**: Add hypothesis tests
4. **Mutation Testing**: Verify test quality
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Enable in GitHub Actions
