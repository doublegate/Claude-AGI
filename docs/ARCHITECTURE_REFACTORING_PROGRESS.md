# Architecture Refactoring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of breaking up the god objects in the Claude-AGI codebase to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Completed Refactoring âœ…

### 1. AGIOrchestrator Refactoring (COMPLETED)

The monolithic AGIOrchestrator has been successfully broken down into focused components:

#### Extracted Components:

1. **ServiceRegistry** (`src/core/service_registry.py`)
   - Manages service registration and lifecycle
   - Handles service discovery
   - Manages service tasks
   - Provides service status tracking

2. **StateManager** (`src/core/state_manager.py`)
   - Manages system state transitions
   - Validates state transitions
   - Maintains state history
   - Provides state statistics
   - Supports state hooks and listeners

3. **EventBus** (`src/core/event_bus.py`)
   - Handles message routing between services
   - Implements publish-subscribe pattern
   - Supports request-response messaging
   - Provides message prioritization
   - Tracks messaging metrics

4. **Refactored AGIOrchestrator** (`src/core/orchestrator_refactored.py`)
   - Thin coordinator using extracted components
   - Maintains backwards compatibility
   - Simplified responsibilities
   - Cleaner architecture

#### Benefits Achieved:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without touching core logic
- **Reusability**: Components can be used independently

#### Migration Support:
- Created migration script (`scripts/migrate_orchestrator.py`)
- Comprehensive test suite for all components
- Backwards compatibility properties in refactored orchestrator

## Remaining Refactoring Tasks ðŸ”„

### 2. MemoryManager Refactoring (PENDING)

Current issues:
- Handles too many responsibilities (working memory, episodic memory, semantic search)
- Direct database operations mixed with business logic
- Difficult to test in isolation

Proposed extraction:
- **WorkingMemoryStore**: Redis operations
- **EpisodicMemoryStore**: PostgreSQL operations  
- **SemanticIndex**: FAISS operations
- **MemoryCoordinator**: Thin coordinator

### 3. TUI Refactoring (PENDING)

Current issues:
- Massive single file with UI, business logic, and event handling
- Difficult to test due to curses dependency
- Hard to add new features

Proposed extraction:
- **UIRenderer**: Pure rendering logic
- **EventHandler**: User input handling
- **BusinessLogic**: Core functionality
- **TUIController**: Thin coordinator

## Architecture Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class now has one reason to change:
- ServiceRegistry changes only for service management updates
- StateManager changes only for state logic updates
- EventBus changes only for messaging updates

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components are open for extension but closed for modification:
- New message types can be added without changing EventBus
- New states can be added with custom transition rules
- New services can be registered without changing registry

### 3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules:
- Orchestrator depends on abstractions (interfaces)
- Services implement standard interfaces
- Easy to swap implementations

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients don't depend on interfaces they don't use:
- ServiceInterface defines minimal required methods
- Optional methods (run, close) are checked at runtime
- Components expose focused APIs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Created:
1. **ServiceRegistry Tests**: Registration, lifecycle, status tracking
2. **StateManager Tests**: Transitions, validation, history, statistics
3. **EventBus Tests**: Message routing, pub-sub, request-response
4. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction, backwards compatibility

### Test Coverage:
- ServiceRegistry: ~95% coverage
- StateManager: ~98% coverage
- EventBus: ~92% coverage
- Refactored Orchestrator: ~90% coverage

## Migration Guide

### For Developers:

1. **Update Imports**:
   ```python
   # Old
   from src.core.orchestrator import AGIOrchestrator, SystemState, Message
   
   # New
   from src.core.orchestrator_refactored import AGIOrchestrator
   from src.core.state_manager import SystemState
   from src.core.event_bus import Message
   ```

2. **Update State Access**:
   ```python
   # Old
   orchestrator.state = SystemState.THINKING
   
   # New
   await orchestrator.transition_to(SystemState.THINKING)
   ```

3. **Update Service Access**:
   ```python
   # Old
   service = orchestrator.services['memory']
   
   # New
   service = orchestrator.get_service('memory')
   ```

### Using Migration Script:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would change
python scripts/migrate_orchestrator.py --dry-run

# Apply changes
python scripts/migrate_orchestrator.py

# Create compatibility shim for gradual migration
python scripts/migrate_orchestrator.py --create-shim
```

## Metrics and Improvements

### Before Refactoring:
- AGIOrchestrator: 314 lines, 15+ responsibilities
- Difficult to test (required mocking everything)
- Circular dependencies with services
- Hard to understand flow

### After Refactoring:
- ServiceRegistry: 180 lines, 1 responsibility
- StateManager: 260 lines, 1 responsibility
- EventBus: 280 lines, 1 responsibility
- Orchestrator: 250 lines, coordination only
- Easy to test each component
- Clear separation of concerns
- No circular dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Complete MemoryManager refactoring**
   - Extract storage components
   - Create memory coordinator
   - Update tests

2. **Complete TUI refactoring**
   - Extract UI rendering
   - Separate event handling
   - Create testable business logic

3. **Update all imports**
   - Run migration script
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Remove old orchestrator.py

4. **Performance optimization**
   - Profile new architecture
   - Optimize message routing
   - Add caching where needed

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with interfaces**: Define clear interfaces before refactoring
2. **Maintain compatibility**: Use properties and shims for gradual migration
3. **Test first**: Write tests for new components before implementation
4. **Document everything**: Clear documentation helps adoption
5. **Incremental approach**: Refactor one component at a time

## Conclusion

The AGIOrchestrator refactoring demonstrates how to successfully break up a god object into focused, testable components. This same approach will be applied to the remaining god objects (MemoryManager and TUI) to complete the architecture refactoring.
