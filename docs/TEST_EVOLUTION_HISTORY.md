# Test Evolution History

This document consolidates the history of test suite development and fixes throughout the Claude-AGI project.

## Test Suite Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Test Suite (153 Tests)
- **Status**: 58 failing tests, 20 errors
- **Coverage**: ~47% (initial measurement)
- **Main Issues**:
  - Event loop closure warnings
  - Async handling problems
  - Mock object issues
  - Missing implementations

### Phase 2: Test Stabilization (2025-06-03)
- **Achievement**: Fixed all 58 failing tests
- **Final Status**: 153/153 tests passing
- **Coverage**: 49.61%
- **Key Fixes Applied**:
  - Fixed event loop warnings with proper async handling
  - Added missing classes and methods to implementations
  - Standardized datetime usage to timezone-aware UTC
  - Proper async mocking throughout test suite
  - Fixed dataclass __replace__ for Python 3.11+
  - Added service task tracking in orchestrator

### Phase 3: Test Suite Expansion (2025-06-04)
- **Achievement**: Added 146 new tests

- Task cancellation before loop closure
- Service lifecycle management

### Mock Improvements
- AsyncMock for all async methods
- Proper orchestrator mock patterns
- Consistent field naming

### Coverage Improvements
- Memory Manager: 53.88% → 95.10%
- Main Module: → 98.72%
- Communication: 62.86% → 84.76%
- API Server: → 82.76%
- API Client: → 85.26%

## Deferred Test Implementations

During the test expansion, several implementations were deferred for future work:

### API Endpoints to Implement
- `/reflection/trigger` - Trigger reflection process
- `/memory` GET - Paginated memory retrieval
- `/memory/store` POST - Direct memory storage
- `/emotional/state` PUT - Update emotional state

### Features Marked for Phase 2
- Advanced exploration engine features
- Emotional processing
- Creative generation
- Meta-cognitive analysis

## Lessons Learned

1. **Event Loop Management**: Always track and cancel service tasks properly
2. **AsyncIO Testing**: Use pytest-asyncio fixtures with proper cleanup
3. **Mock Patterns**: Consistent AsyncMock usage for async methods
4. **Field Naming**: Ensure Pydantic models match test expectations
5. **Coverage Focus**: Target specific modules for dramatic improvements
6. **Test Organization**: Separate extended tests for better maintainability

## Current Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific categories
pytest tests/unit -v
pytest tests/integration -v
pytest tests/safety -v
pytest tests/performance -v

# Run with local CI script
python scripts/ci-local.py
```

## Future Test Priorities

1. **TUI Testing**: Currently has 291 uncovered lines
2. **Integration Tests**: More cross-component scenarios
3. **Load Testing**: Stress test the consciousness streams
4. **Security Penetration**: Attempt to bypass security measures
5. **Database Integration**: When PostgreSQL/Redis are added
