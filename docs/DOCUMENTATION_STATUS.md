# Documentation Status and Organization

This document tracks the current state of all documentation in the Claude-AGI project and provides guidance on which documents are active, historical, or need updates.

## Documentation Categories

### 🟢 Active Documentation (Currently Maintained)

These documents are actively used and should be kept up to date:

#### Core Documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **GETTING_STARTED.md** - Environment setup and initial configuration
- **ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md** - System design and component relationships
- **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Directory layout and file organization
- **RUNNING_THE_TUI.md** - TUI usage guide and commands
- **TUI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common TUI issues and solutions

#### Development Guides
- **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Test suite documentation (needs update to 299 tests)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Current project state and progress

#### Planning Documents
- **PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Next phase development guide
- **ARCHITECTURAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Refactoring plans for Phase 2
- **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md** - Scaling and optimization strategies
- **MEMORY_SYNCHRONIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Memory consistency solutions

### 📝 Task Tracking (Active)

- **MASTER_TODO.md** - Primary task list and project status
- **PHASE_1_REMAINING_TASKS.md** - Remaining Phase 1 blockers
- **PHASE_2_ROADMAP.md** - Phase 2 planning and priorities

### 📚 Historical Reference (Completed Work)

These documents represent completed work and serve as historical reference:

#### Test Completion Records
- **TEST_STABILIZATION_GUIDE.md** - Fixed 58 failing tests (completed)
- **TEST_SUITE_FIXES.md** - Detailed test fixes (completed)
- **TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of test modifications
- **DEFERRED_TEST_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md** - Test expansion to 299 tests (completed)

#### Phase 1 Completion
- **PHASE_1_COMPLETED.md** - Phase 1 accomplishments
- **SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-06-04.md** - CI/CD optimization session

### ⚠️ Needs Review/Update

- **SECURITY_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md** - Outdated (security already implemented)
- **PHASE_1_TO_2_TRANSITION.md** - May need updates based on completed work

## Documentation Updates Required

### 1. Update TESTING_GUIDE.md
Current shows 153 tests, needs update to reflect:
- 299 total tests
- 72.80% code coverage
- New test categories and organization

### 2. Consolidate Security Documentation
- Security hardening is COMPLETE (implemented in this session)
- SECURITY_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md is outdated
- Security implementation is documented in PHASE_1_COMPLETED.md

### 3. Remove Redundant Documents
After ensuring information is preserved:
- Consider archiving completed test fix documents
- Consolidate overlapping security documentation

## Next Actions

1. **Update TESTING_GUIDE.md** with current test statistics
2. **Archive SECURITY_HARDENING_CHECKLIST.md** as it's now outdated
3. **Consolidate test fix documentation** into a single reference document
4. **Create structured folders** for better organization (optional)
5. **Update MASTER_TODO.md** to reflect security completion

## Documentation Standards

- Keep active documentation current with each major change
- Archive completed work for historical reference
- Use clear status indicators in task tracking documents
- Maintain separation between planning and implementation docs
- Regular reviews to prevent documentation drift
