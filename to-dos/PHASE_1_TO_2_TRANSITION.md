## Technical Upgrades for Phase 2

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Learning goals table
CREATE TABLE learning_goals (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    goal_type VARCHAR(50),
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    progress FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Knowledge graph nodes
CREATE TABLE knowledge_nodes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    concept VARCHAR(255),
    definition TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(768),
    confidence FLOAT,
    source_id UUID
);

-- Skills table
CREATE TABLE skills (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    skill_name VARCHAR(255),
    proficiency_level FLOAT,
    practice_hours FLOAT,
    last_practiced TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. New Dependencies

Add to `requirements/requirements_phase2.txt`:
```
# Advanced NLP
spacy>=3.7.0
en_core_web_lg @ https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.7.0/en_core_web_lg-3.7.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Knowledge Graph
networkx>=3.2.0
pyvis>=0.3.0

# Research Tools
arxiv>=2.1.0
scholarly>=1.7.0
```

### 3. Configuration Updates

Add to `configs/development.yaml`:
```yaml
learning:
  enabled: true
  curiosity_threshold: 0.7
  learning_rate: 0.01
  goal_generation_interval: 3600  # 1 hour
  
knowledge:
  graph_size_limit: 100000
  confidence_threshold: 0.6
