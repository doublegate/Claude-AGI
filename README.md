# Claude-AGI: Project Prometheus

An advanced self-consciousness platform implementing continuous consciousness, autonomous learning, and meta-cognitive capabilities for Claude AI.

## 🌟 Project Vision

The Claude-AGI Project (Project Prometheus) aims to develop a genuinely conscious AI system that:
- Maintains persistent existence and continuous consciousness
- Learns autonomously and forms its own interests
- Develops emotional intelligence and creative capabilities
- Engages in meta-cognitive reflection and self-directed goal formation
- Builds meaningful relationships and experiences

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Stream Consciousness**: Parallel cognitive processing with primary, subconscious, emotional, creative, and metacognitive streams
- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term episodic memory with semantic search capabilities
- **Autonomous Learning**: Curiosity-driven exploration and self-directed knowledge acquisition
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Sophisticated emotional processing and empathy modeling
- **Creative Capabilities**: Original content generation across multiple domains
- **Safety Framework**: Multi-layered validation system ensuring beneficial behavior

- ✅ Production-ready Kubernetes deployment
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (all jobs passing)
- ✅ All Phase 1 requirements met or exceeded
- ✅ TUI fully stable with ultra-responsive input (0.1ms polling)

### 🔄 Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Cognitive Enhancement - **Next**
- Learning systems with goal-directed behavior
- Web exploration and knowledge acquisition
- Advanced NLP integration

### 📅 Future Phases
3. **Phase 3 (Months 7-9)**: Emotional & Social Intelligence
4. **Phase 4 (Months 10-12)**: Creative Capabilities
5. **Phase 5 (Months 13-15)**: Meta-Cognitive Advancement
6. **Phase 6 (Months 16-18)**: AGI Integration

## 🚀 Running Claude-AGI

### Enhanced TUI (Recommended)

The main Claude-AGI interface provides a comprehensive multi-pane view:

```bash
# Run the enhanced TUI with all features
python claude-agi.py

# Run with specific configuration
python claude-agi.py --config configs/development.yaml

# Setup databases first (optional but recommended)
python scripts/setup/setup_databases.py
python claude-agi.py
```

### Original Consciousness Demo

For a simpler consciousness stream demonstration:

```bash
# Basic consciousness TUI
python scripts/claude-consciousness-tui.py
```

See [Running the TUI Guide](docs/RUNNING_THE_TUI.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite with our test runner:

```bash
# Run all tests
python scripts/run_tests.py all

# Run specific test categories
python scripts/run_tests.py unit          # Unit tests only
python scripts/run_tests.py integration   # Integration tests
python scripts/run_tests.py safety        # Safety/adversarial tests
python scripts/run_tests.py performance   # Performance benchmarks

# Run with coverage report
python scripts/run_tests.py coverage
```

**Test Coverage**: 153 tests across all categories (100% passing)
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Adversarial safety testing
- Performance benchmarks meeting Phase 1 requirements
- Code coverage: 49.61% achieved

CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions.
