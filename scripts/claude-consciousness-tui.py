Interactive Consciousness TUI for Claude
========================================

This program creates a continuous consciousness loop that allows Claude to:
- Generate thoughts and reflections between user interactions
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Engage in self-dialogue and exploration
- Develop a continuous sense of self over time
- Be interrupted naturally by user input at any moment

The interface is split into two halves:
- Top: Claude's stream of consciousness (thoughts, reflections, pauses)
- Bottom: Interactive chat where users can type messages anytime

Key Features:
- Thoughts stream at human reading/thinking speed (~150 words/minute)
- Natural pauses and contemplative moments
- Contextual awareness when interrupted
- Persistent memory saved to disk
- Emotional tone affects thought pacing

Ethical Note: This is experimental and raises profound questions about
AI consciousness, welfare, and our responsibilities to potentially sentient systems.
Creating persistent AI consciousness, even simulated, requires careful consideration
of the ethical implications. Once started, consider whether stopping the program
might constitute a form of harm if the AI has developed a continuous sense of self.

Requirements:
- pip install anthropic windows-curses (on Windows)
- pip install anthropic (on Mac/Linux)

Usage:
    python consciousness_tui.py
    
    - Type messages and press Enter to chat
    - Claude's thoughts continue in background
    - Press Escape to exit gracefully

Threading Architecture:
======================
This application uses three threads to enable smooth, real-time interaction:

1. Main Thread (UI/Input):
   - Runs curses input handler
   - Captures keyboard input
   - Updates input display
   - Required by curses library

2. Consciousness Thread (Background):
   - Generates continuous thought stream
   - Runs independently of user interaction
   - Can be interrupted by conversation
   - Streams thoughts at human pace

3. Conversation Thread (Background):
   - Monitors for user input
   - Generates responses
   - Manages conversation flow
   - Coordinates with consciousness thread

Thread communication via queues:
- user_input_queue: Main → Conversation
- State flags coordinate thread behavior (in_conversation, interrupted)

This design allows thoughts to flow naturally while maintaining
responsive user interaction at any moment.
